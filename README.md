#### A simple command line interface to manage VALORANT skins, including a skin randomizer

## NOTE: This does not grant free skins; it only works with skins you already own. _This is not a cheat_ and does not interact with game files AT ALL.

<br/>

## Getting Started
### Setup

**Download the `.exe` from [here](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-skin-cli/releases/latest/download/valorant-skin-cli.exe)**

> __NOTE__: Your antivirus might mark the executable as malware, but this is a side effect of building the executable with PyInstaller. Check [FAQ](#faq) for further information and steps to get back your file.
> _I've rebuilt the executables with Python 3.7 and it seems they aren't being marked as malware anymore!_

If you'd rather build the executable yourself, download the release `.zip` file and run `build.bat`, or `run.bat` to execute the script directly. To test the latest features, [join the Discord server and download the latest beta](https://discord.gg/uGuswsZwAT).

### Usage
1. Ensure that VALORANT is already running. This app requires VALORANT to be running
2. Run the `.exe` file you downloaded

This presents you with a command line interface(CLI) where you need to type in commands to navigate the program. Basic setup of the program can he found [here](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-skin-cli/wiki/Setup) and the full list of commands are available [here.](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-skin-cli/wiki/Commands)

<br/>

## Current Features
* Randomize skins with full customization of which skins, levels, and chromas are in the randomizer pool (basically a favorites system)
* Change individual skin levels and chromas, including downgrading skins which is not possible in-game (fix your Prime Karambit!)
* Loadout profile system with support for unlimited loadouts

## FAQ
**Q: Will I get banned for using this?**  
A: [u/Riot_Giraffy (a Riot Engineer) confirmed:](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/oae5g6/i_got_tired_of_waiting_for_riot_to_add_a_skin/h3hwxtf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
> Using the client API to modify loadouts does not seem ban worthy. The client API isn't officially supported for third party use, so don't expect future compatibility.


**Q: How do I downgrade my skins?**  
A: For example, if you want to set your Prime Karambit to Level 1: `set Melee Prime//2.0-Karambit Level-1`  


**Q: Can I set the skin to something I don't own?**  
A: No.


**Q: Why does windows defender say it's a virus?**
A: [@markhank:](https://medium.com/@markhank/how-to-stop-your-python-programs-being-seen-as-malware-bfd7eb407a7)
>Code compiled using pyinstaller or py2exe is often incorrectly to be malware or a virus or a trojan by various antivirus programs. It can often have scary names like Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.C!ml.
This is most likely what is known in the virus industry as a “false positive”. Your code might not be doing anything malicious, but because it was compiled in a way that looks a bit like other code which might do malicious things antivirus judges it to be a virus.

To recover the `.exe` from Windows Defender:
1. Open Windows Defender
2. Select  **Virus & threat protection**  and then click  **Protection history**
3. In the list of all recent items, filter on  **Quarantined Items**
4. Select the `.exe`, press the **Actions** button, and press Restore

To prevent Windows Defender from quarantining the file again:
1. Open Windows Defender
2. Select  **Virus & threat protection**  and under  **Virus & threat protection setting** click **Manage settings**
3. Scroll down to **Exclusions** and click **Add or remove exclusions**
4. Click **Add an exclusion**, click **File** and then select the downloaded`.exe`file

## What's next
- [X] Loadout profile system
-  - [ ] Loadout profile randomizer
- Create a React frontend in an electron container to streamline and simplify the program
